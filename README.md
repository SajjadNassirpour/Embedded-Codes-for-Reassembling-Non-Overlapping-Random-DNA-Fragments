##  Embedded Codes for Reassembling Non-Overlapping Random DNA Fragments
These simulation codes are evaluated the results of the paper in MATLAB. Simulation Codes contain following results:

### Results of Tables II, III and IV
This code evaluates the results which are shown in Table II, Table III and Table IV. You should use k2=0 if you are going to encode each data sub-string by only one VT code (Table II). Moreover, you should select enough large value for limited permutation to achieve the results of different k1 and k2 in Table III and Table IV.

### Proposed VT Encoder-Decoder
This code runs our proposed scheme for VT encoder-decoder. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 are two outputs of this code which represent the Average decoding error for four different breaking patterns and Average decoding iterations normalized by M!, respectively.
